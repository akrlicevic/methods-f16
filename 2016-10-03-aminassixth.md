The past few weeks have been interesting in class, don’t get me wrong! But it was definitely entertaining to watch a show on Netflix in class! Just hearing the title, I thought that it would be a boring fairy tale show, but it turned out to be the opposite. It was entertaining throughout and it kept me on my feet to see what would happen next. It was hard to keep track of interactions because I was too focused on enjoying the show. (I might even start watching it now in my free time!) 
In the show, I would definitely say that Emma is a main character, along with Prince Charming. They would definitely have the most interactions with the rest of the characters, including one another. There was a lot of characters in the show, but the problem was throwing in all these characters at the beginning and introducing each one. There was a lot to keep track of to build our web. It was easy though to see the differences when they went from the real world to the fairy tale world. However, just looking at the web, one can see the main interactions and the characters who are more important to the plot than others. Using a Netflix show was definitely an interesting way to learn about network analysis. It’s probably the most interesting thing we’ve covered so far in my opinion!
